Minor things:

- add required time support

- clean end-of-line markers (CR is more preferable than CR-LF)

- mysterious Mac problem (fixed?)
- mysterious Solaris problem (fixed)

- QR's compilation problems

- add storage for internal memory for node names in the ABC_ package

- prevent node name clash between PO and internal names (i.e. [484])
- add the output of ABC version/platform in the output files

- fix gcc compiler warnings

- update CVS regularly


Major things:

- substantially improving performance of FRAIGing 
(used in equivalence checking and lossless synthesis)

- developing a new (much more efficient and faster) AIG rewriting package

- implementing additional rewriting options for delay optimization

- making technology mapping applicable to very large designs by adding 
on-demand cut computation currenlty available as a stand-alone command "cut"

- experimenting with yield-aware standard-cell mapping

- developing a hybrid mapper for arbitrary programmable macrocell 
architecture specified using a configuration file (this mapper should work 
for both cell-evalution and mainstream FPGA mapping)

- developing incremental retiming and incremental integrated sequential 
synthesis

- developing sequential verification combined with integrated sequential 
synthesis 

- add hierarchical BLIF interface (for designs with black boxes)
