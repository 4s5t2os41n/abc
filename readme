Often the code comes directly from a Windows computer.
The following steps may be needed to compile it on UNIX:

>> dos2unix Makefile Makefile
>> dos2unix depends.sh depends.sh
>> chmod 755 depends.sh
>> make 

If compiling as a static library, it is necessary to uncomment
#define _LIB in "src/abc/main/main.c"


Several things to try if it does not compile on your platform:
- Try running all code through dos2unix (Solaris)
- Try removing flags from the libs line (LIBS :=) in Makefile (Mac)

Finally, run regression test:
abc>>> so regtest.script
