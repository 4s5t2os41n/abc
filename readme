Often the code comes directly from a Windows computer.
The following steps may be needed to compile it on UNIX:

>> dos2unix Makefile Makefile
>> dos2unix depends.sh depends.sh
>> chmod 755 depends.sh
>> make 

If compiling as a static library, it is necessary to uncomment
#define _LIB in "src/abc/main/main.c"
